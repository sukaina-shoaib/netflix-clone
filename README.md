# netflix clone

The Netflix Clone is a front-end project that replicates the look and feel of the Netflix homepage, including a login page.
This project is built using HTML and CSS, and it's ideal for those learning web development 
who want to practice structuring and styling a webpage. Note that this project is purely static and
does not include any back-end functionality.
